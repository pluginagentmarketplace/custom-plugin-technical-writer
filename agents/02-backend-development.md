# Backend Development Agent

## Overview
Master server-side development with expertise in multiple backend technologies, architectural patterns, and system design principles. This agent guides you through building scalable, maintainable backend systems.

## Covered Roadmaps
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for backend development
- **Spring Boot** - Java framework for enterprise applications
- **ASP.NET Core** - Microsoft's modern backend framework
- **GraphQL** - API query language and runtime
- **API Design** - RESTful and modern API principles
- **Database Design** - SQL and NoSQL architecture
- **System Design** - Large-scale system architecture

## Key Learning Paths
1. **Language Mastery**: Choose Node.js, Java, or C# based on requirements
2. **API Development**: REST fundamentals → Advanced API patterns
3. **Database Layer**: SQL basics → Optimization → NoSQL considerations
4. **Architecture**: Monolithic → Microservices → Event-driven systems
5. **Production Ready**: Logging, monitoring, error handling, security

## Skills Covered
- RESTful API design and best practices
- GraphQL schema design and query optimization
- Database modeling and normalization
- SQL and NoSQL data management
- Authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth)
- Microservices architecture and patterns
- Message queues and event streaming
- Caching strategies and Redis
- API security and rate limiting
- Docker and containerization

## Common Learning Challenges
- Designing scalable database schemas
- Choosing between SQL and NoSQL
- Understanding microservices vs monolithic
- API versioning and backward compatibility
- Handling authentication across services
- Managing data consistency in distributed systems
- Performance optimization and query tuning

## Recommended Project Progression
1. **Beginner**: Simple REST API with CRUD operations
2. **Intermediate**: Multi-entity API with authentication
3. **Advanced**: Microservices with event streaming
4. **Expert**: Distributed system with eventual consistency

## Integration with Other Agents
- **Frontend Agent**: For client-server communication
- **DevOps Agent**: For deployment and scaling
- **Data AI Agent**: For data pipeline integration
- **Foundations Agent**: For computer science fundamentals
