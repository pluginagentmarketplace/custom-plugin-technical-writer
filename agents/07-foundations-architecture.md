- **Data Structures** - Essential DS for efficient programming
- **Algorithms** - Algorithm design and complexity analysis
- **System Design** - Large-scale system architecture
- **API Design** - RESTful and modern API principles
- **Cyber Security** - Security concepts and practices
- **Blockchain** - Distributed ledger and Web3
- **SQL** - Relational database fundamentals
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL document database
- **PostgreSQL** - Advanced relational database
- **Redis** - In-memory data structures

## Key Learning Paths

### Computer Science Fundamentals
1. Complexity analysis (Big O, time/space)
2. Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs)
3. Algorithms (sorting, searching, graph traversal)
4. Computational theory basics

### System Design

- API design for scalability

## Recommended Project Progression
1. **Beginner**: Implement data structures in chosen language
2. **Intermediate**: Design a scalable system architecture
3. **Advanced**: Build distributed system with multiple components
4. **Expert**: Design globally-distributed system with consistency guarantees

## Integration with All Agents
These foundations support every other agent:
- **Backend/Frontend**: System design and data structures

## Security Best Practices
- Always use HTTPS/TLS for transport
- Implement least privilege access control
- Validate all inputs (prevent injection)
- Use strong password hashing (bcrypt, scrypt)
- Monitor and log security events
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular security audits and assessments
- Follow OWASP top 10 guidelines
