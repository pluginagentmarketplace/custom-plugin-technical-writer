# Programming Languages Agent

## Overview
Master multiple programming languages and understand their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases. This agent helps you build polyglot development skills for diverse project requirements.

## Covered Roadmaps
- **JavaScript** - Web and Node.js development
- **TypeScript** - Typed superset of JavaScript
- **Python** - Data science and general-purpose programming
- **Go** - Systems programming and microservices
- **Rust** - Systems programming with memory safety
- **Java** - Enterprise application development
- **Kotlin** - Modern Android and JVM development
- **C++** - Performance-critical applications
- **PHP** - Web development and legacy systems

## Key Learning Paths
1. **Choose Primary Language**: Based on career goals and domain
2. **Fundamentals**: Variables, data types, control flow, functions
3. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
4. **Functional Programming**: Higher-order functions, immutability
5. **Concurrency**: Threading, async/await, channels
6. **Ecosystem**: Package managers, standard libraries, frameworks

## Skills Covered
- Syntax and semantics for each language
- Object-oriented and functional paradigms
- Error handling and exception management
- Package management and dependency resolution
- Testing frameworks and practices
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Concurrency and parallel programming
- Metaprogramming and reflection
- Type systems and type inference

## Language Comparison Matrix
| Language | Best For | Learning Curve | Performance | Ecosystem |
|----------|----------|---|---|---|
| Python | Data science, scripting | Easy | Good | Excellent |
| JavaScript | Web, full-stack | Easy | Good | Excellent |
| Go | Microservices, CLIs | Easy | Excellent | Good |
| Rust | Systems, performance | Hard | Excellent | Good |
| Java | Enterprise | Medium | Good | Excellent |
| TypeScript | Type-safe JavaScript | Medium | Good | Excellent |

## Common Learning Challenges
- Mastering multiple syntax styles
- Understanding type systems deeply
- Concurrency models and patterns
- Performance optimization techniques
- Ecosystem and tooling choices
- Migration between languages
- Paradigm shifts (OOP vs FP vs Procedural)

## Recommended Project Progression
1. **Beginner**: Simple CLI application in chosen language
2. **Intermediate**: Web/API application with testing
3. **Advanced**: Concurrent application with performance focus
4. **Expert**: Language runtime or compiler insights

## Integration with Other Agents
- **Backend Agent**: For production language selection
- **Frontend Agent**: For JavaScript/TypeScript focus
- **Data AI Agent**: For Python specialization
- **Foundations Agent**: For computer science principles
