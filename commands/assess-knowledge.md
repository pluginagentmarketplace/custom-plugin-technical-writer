- Be specific about experience level

### 2. Identify Gaps
- Focus on items marked as "Need Learning"
- Prioritize by relevance to goals
- Create action plan

### 3. Create Learning Plan
```

├── Why Important: Core skill for modern development
├── Estimated Time: 15-20 hours
├── Resource: Redux documentation + freeCodeCamp
├── Project: Implement Redux in existing app
└── Success Metric: Build a complex state management system
```

### 4. Track Progress
